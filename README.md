Slice and Dice Analysis is a data exploration technique that allows data to be dissected, viewed from different angles, and analyzed in depth

‘Slicing’ involves selecting a specific subset of data from a larger dataset, focusing on one variable or dimension, such as viewing sales data for a particular product line or a single region. Think of it as isolating one layer of your data to analyze it in greater detail.

In this code, you can upload any csv of your own and with the plots implemented, it's able to provide a visual view of diversity of your dataset. You can even apply filters on any variables.
